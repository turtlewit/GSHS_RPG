Maps are formatted like most of the other data files.

For each new object, the first line is 'start'.
Following that, you write the variable name, a space, then the value.
For tile descriptions, surround the text with quotation marks ("").
This will support new lines.
To close an object definition, type 'end' on new line.

Example:

start
location 0,0
ldesc "You stand in a large forest full of trees.
There is a rather nasty smell about"
sdesc "Forest of trees."
end
