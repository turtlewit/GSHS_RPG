# GSHS_RPG
A Sci-Fi RPG being developed by the GSHS Programming class

Dependencies:

* Python 3 (Our main compiler is 3.2)
* Colorama

Not tested on Linux or Mac. The only forseeable problems they would have is clearing the console (GSHS_RPG clears the console every turn)

Idea Checklist:

* Sanity
* Random encounters
* Turn-based combat
* Spaceship hub
* Character creation / Classes, attributes, skills?
* Resource management: Food, Fuel, etc.
* NPCs: medics, techs, etc.

Roadmap:

1. ~~General story / end goal / gameplay written by concept and story.~~
2. ~~Basic engine written by engine programmers.~~
3. **Specific planets / objects / etc. written by concept and story.**
4. **Content developers start on planets / items / enemies / etc.**
5. Basic engine mostly complete, combat / quests / etc start by engine programmers.
6. Continue cycle of concept -> content -> engine until it's ready to be tested by QA.

TODO ATM:

Concept:

* **Start writing story, lore.**
* Design specific gameplay mechanics.
* ~~Create an end goal.~~

Content Devs:

* Work with concept until the engine is ready

Engine Programmers:

* Create classes for enemies, **player**, **NPCs**, planets, **items**, etc.
* ~~Get basic movement and tile descriptions working.~~
* Get basic entities to appear on tiles.
* Develop content loading and file structure for content.
