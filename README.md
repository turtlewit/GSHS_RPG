# Verloren
Verloren, or otherwise called by its working title GSHS_RPG, is a text-based, turn-based RPG built 100% in Python. It runs natively in the terminal and can be run straight from Python or run from an executable. The game is currently in development by the GSHS Programming Class.

Dependencies:

* Python 3 (Our main compiler is 3.4)
* SimpleAudio
* Curses (comes with python, Windows requires [alternate version](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses))

Tested on Windows, Linux, and Android. Mac should work fine.
