Roadmap:

1. ~~General story / end goal / gameplay written by concept and story.~~
2. ~~Basic engine written by engine programmers.~~
3. **Specific planets / objects / etc. written by concept and story.**
4. **Content developers start on planets / items / enemies / etc.**
5. Basic engine mostly complete, combat / quests / etc start by engine programmers.
6. Continue cycle of concept -> content -> engine until it's ready to be tested by QA.
